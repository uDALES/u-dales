# Pre-processing

This guide explains how to set up the input files of your simulation. The idea is that you already have a simulation set up, and now you want to modify some of the parameters of your simulation. If you do not have a simulation yet, have a look at the [set-up](https://github.com/uDALES/u-dales/blob/master/docs/udales-getting-started.md#set-up) section in our getting started guide.

The parameters of the simulation are set in the `namoptions` file of your experiment. Some parameter changes require the additional [input files](#Input-files) to be re-written, which will be done automatically by the pre-processing. The next section provides an overview of these parameters.

## Pre-processing parameters

Some parameters used by uDALES are also used in the pre-processing. They are the following:

### `&DOMAIN`

- `imax`: number of cells in x-direction. Default: 64.
- `jtot`: number of cells in y-direction. Default: 64.
- `kmax`: number of cells in z-direction. Default: 96.
- `xsize`: domain size in x-direction (metres).
- `ysize`: domain size in y-direction (metres).

### `&WALLS`

- `nblocks`: number of blocks. The value is generated by the pre-processing routines, so if this parameter is omitted, `write_inputs.sh` (see below) will write it and its value. If it given, `write_inputs.sh` will overwrite the value.
- `nfcts`: number of facets. The value is generated by the pre-processing routines, so if this parameter is omitted, `write_inputs.sh` (see below) will write it and its value. If it given, `write_inputs.sh` will overwrite the value.

### `&PHYSICS`

- `luoutflowr`: switch that determines whether u-velocity is corrected to get a fixed outflow rate Default: false.
- `lvoutflowr`: switch that determines whether v-velocity is corrected to get a fixed outflow rate. Default: false.
- `luvolflowr`: switch that determines whether u-velocity is corrected to get a fixed volume flow rate. Default: false.
- `lvvolflowr`: switch that determines whether v-velocity is corrected to get a fixed volume flow rate. Default: false.
- `lcoriol`: switch for coriolis force. Default: false.
- `lprofforc`: switch for nudging flow to a profile. Default: false.

Note only one forcing should be specified, i.e. one of `luoutflowr`/`lvoutflowr`,`luvolflowr`/`lvvolflowr`, `lprofforc`, or `lcoriol`.

### `&ENERGYBALANCE`

- `lEB`: switch for energy balance. Default: false.

### `&CHEMISTRY`

- `lchem`: switch for chemistry.

### `&SCALARS`

- `nsv`: number of scalar variables. Default: 0. Note that `nsv > 0` is not yet supported in the pre-processing.

### `&INPS`

The parameters under the `&INPS` header are used only in the pre-processing.

If using the energy balance, the following parameters can also be specified.

- `Z`: solar zenith (degrees). Default: 28.4066.
- `I`: direct solar radiation (W/m^2). Default: 184.8775.
- `Dsk`: diffuse incoming radiation (W/m^2). Default: 418.8041.

The following parameters relate to generating `blocks.inp`. Only one of the following three methods should be used.

- `canyonwidth`: width of canyon (cells). Default: 16.

## Run

The `write_inputs.sh` shell script is a wrapper around the MATALB pre-processing functions of `preprocessing.m`. For more info about the functions see [Developer's guide](#developers-guide). The script requires several variables to be set up. Below is an example setup for copying and pasting. You can also specify these parameters in a `config.sh` file within the experiment directory, which is then read by the scripts.

``` sh
# We assume you are running the following commands from your
# top-level project directory.

export DA_TOOLSDIR=$(pwd)/u-dales/tools # Directory of the scripts
export DA_EXPDIR=$(pwd)/experiments #  The top-level directory of the simulation setups
```

Then, to start the pre-processing, run:

``` sh
# We assume you are running the following commands from your
# top-level project directory.

# General syntax: write_inputs.sh exp_id
./u-dales/tools/write_inputs.sh 009
```

Replace 009 with the number of your simulation.

## Developer's guide

The `u-dales/tools/preprocessing.m` matlab class contains the functionality for preprocessing. The constructor reads the parameters in `namoptions` and stores them as member variables, and defines default variables for those not specified. These are then used in the member functions. In these member functions, additional data structures are also stored as member variables, including those used repeatedly and those eventually written to files, so that one can easily view and manipulate them using the matlab IDE.

The `u-dales/tools/write_inputs.m` matlab script calls member functions of `preprocessing.m` in order to write the necessary input files for uDALES. It is intended to be as short and readable as possible, with the goal being that a developer can edit for a particular purpose, perhaps by calling a member function they have added to `preprocessing.m`. It will work simply as a normal script using the matlab IDE, but when doing this, ensure that `DA_EXPDIR = <top level directory>/experiments/` and `DA_TOOLSDIR = <top level directory>/u-dales/tools/` are defined.

The `u-dales/tools/write_inputs.sh` shell script acts as a wrapper around `write_inputs.m`. Before running the matlab script, it will run the shell script `config.sh` located in the experiment directory, which defines environmental variables `DA_EXPDIR` and `DA_TOOLSDIR`. After running the script, it will also write the correct number of blocks and facets to `namoptions`. It is intended to be run from the top level project directory.

```sh
# We assume you are running the following commands from your
# top-level project directory.

# General syntax: write_inputs.sh exp_id
./u-dales/tools/write_inputs.sh 009
```

### Input files

uDALES requires a number of input files, all suffixed by the experiment number, which is omitted in the following documentation. The `namoptions.inp` file contains a list of parameters for uDALES and the pre-processing routines, and the pre-processing is intended to run using solely this file (with some exceptions). The input files are:

- `xgrid.inp`: list of x grid values
- `zgrid.inp`: list of z grid values.
- `prof.inp`: initial profiles of flow variables (described in DALES documentation).
- `lscale.inp`: large-scale forcings (described in DALES documentation).
- `blocks.inp`: block position and corresponding facets (described below).
- `facets.inp`: facet orientation and corresponding block (described below).
- `Tfacinit.inp`: list of initial facet temperatures.
- `walltypes.inp`: a description of the properties of different types of facet (described below). This is copied to the experiment directory automatically.

If using scalars, `scalar.inp` is also required to specifiy the initial scalar profiles.
When using the energy balance, the following additional files are required:

- `facetarea.inp`: list of the areas of facets.
- `vf.nc.inp`: view factors of facets (stored as a netcdf file).
- `svf.inp`: list of the sky view factors of facets.
- `netsw.inp`: list of net shortwave radiation on facets.

#### Structure of `blocks.inp`

Each row describes a block, with the first 6 columns giving the lower (l) and upper (u) limit in each direction (i,j,k), in the order: il, iu, jl, ju, kl, ku.
The next 5 columns give the facets that make up the faces of the block, in the order: top, west, east, north, south. (Note east is assumed to be aligned with the i-direction).

#### Structure of `facets.inp`

Each row describes a facet, with columns giving the orientation, wall type id, block id, and building id.

#### Structure of `walltypes.inp`

Each row describes a wall type, with the first 6 columns being: wall type id, a boolean for whether it is a 'green' facet or not, momentum roughness length, heat roughness length, albedo, and emissivity. Assuming that each facet is composed of 3 layers, the next 3 columns give the thickness of each, the next 3 give the volumetric heat capacity, the next 3 give the heat conductivity, and the final 4 give the thermal diffusivity at each interface between the layers.

For examples, please refer to the [example simulations](./udales-example-simulations.md).

### Visualising geometries

There are a number of functions in the `preprocessing` class that can be called from the Matlab editor in order to visualise the geometry. Assuming the instance of the preprocessing class is named `r`, `plot_bl(r)` plots the buildings, `plot_blocks(r)` plots the buildings and the roads, and `plot_facets(r)` plots all the facets.
