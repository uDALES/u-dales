## To use:

- Clone the [pFUnit] repository _into this directory_.
- Cd into the `pFUnit` directory and follow the [pFUnit build instructions].
- Build uDALES in your preferred manner.
- In the same directory as the created `u-dales` executable is a `unit_tests`
  executable. Running this executes the unit test suite.
